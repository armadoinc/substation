# example

These configs accompany the example pipeline in `build/terraform/aws` and can be built by executing `build/jsonnet/compile.sh` from the project root. Each file includes comments that explains the impact of the config on each Substation app.

Note that these example configs follow the best practices described in `config/README.md` -- each app deployed to the pipeline has a unique folder for its config(s).
